## About the Project

This was our last team project in [Codecool](https://codecool.com/)'s 10-month Full-Stack developer course. It was a 4-sprint long project.<br>
**TaskTiger** is a platform where clients can connect with 'Taskers' to complete different jobs/tasks for them, creating easier access to different service providers. All this within a few comfortable clicks/taps.<br>
The project includes authentication and authorization, profile pages, booking reservations, messaging, reviewing, along with many other features.

**This repository is only the frontend of the project!** You can find the backend repository [here](https://github.com/CodecoolGlobal/el-proyecte-grande-sprint-1-java-fulopdenes).

_This README is only about the frontend part of the project. For the backend documentation, refer to the backend repository's README._

### Used Technologies

* Javascript
* Node.js
* React.js
* React Router
* Vite

## Getting Started

You'll need the Node Package Manager (`npm`) installed on your computer. To install the dependencies, type the following command into your terminal from the root directory of the project:
```sh
npm install
```
When the insatallation finished, you can start the application with this command:
```sh
npm run dev
```

The application needs the backend server running on port `8080`. If the backend server is running on another port, it can be changed in the `vite.config.js` file.
